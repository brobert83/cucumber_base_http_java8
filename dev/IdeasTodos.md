# Todo
- come up with a better groupid/name
- push to maven central
- enhance the body assert to work for other things than json
- add cookie support

# Ideas
- make also a project for sql steps (JPA)
- make also a project for api mocking (wiremock); there is already code in the tests here that can be reused
